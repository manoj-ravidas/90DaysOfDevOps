##Task

Today’s goal is to set the foundation for your DevOps journey.

I will create a 90-day personal DevOps learning plan that clearly defines:

    What is your understanding of DevOps and Cloud Engineering?
    Why you are starting learning DevOps & Cloud?
    Where do you want to reach?
    How you will stay consistent every single day?

This is not a generic plan.
This is your career execution blueprint for the next 90 days.

Day 02 – Linux Architecture, Processes, and systemd
Task

Today’s goal is to understand how Linux works under the hood.

You will create a short note that explains:

    The core components of Linux (kernel, user space, init/systemd)
    How processes are created and managed
    What systemd does and why it matters

This is the foundation for all troubleshooting you will do as a DevOps engineer.

# Core Components of Linux

# Kernel
The kernel is the core of Linux. It manages hardware resources such as CPU, memory, disk, and network, and acts as a bridge between hardware and applications.

# User Space
User space is where users and applications run. It includes the shell, system commands, and application software. User space cannot access hardware directly and communicates with it through the kernel.

# Init / systemd
Init or systemd is the first process that starts when the system boots. It manages system services, starts them at boot time, and keeps the system running smoothly.
